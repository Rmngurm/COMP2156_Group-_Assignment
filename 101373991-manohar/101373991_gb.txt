Experiential Learning in an umbrella term used to cover all of the opportunities available to students to take part in sector-specific learning experiences. These opportunities can take place in a variety of settings including workplaces, simulation facilities, labs, shops, and studios in both educational, workplace and practice environments. They are a chance for students to experience their field or industry and learn what’s expected of them before graduating.
“The GBC students really stood out. They were energized, inquisitive, professional, and experimented with multiple tools and different approaches. The communication was effective, even though it was all via Zoom and with a two-hour time zone difference. The students were timely, and delivered the work products as instructed, sometimes going well above and beyond.”
