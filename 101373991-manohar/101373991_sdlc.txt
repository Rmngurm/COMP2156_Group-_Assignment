DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development ( Dev) and IT operations ( Ops ). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the Agile methodology.
The DevOps lifecycle consists of eight phases representing the processes, capabilities, and tools needed for development (on the left side of the loop) and operations (on the right side of the loop). Throughout each phase, teams collaborate and communicate to maintain alignment, velocity, and quality. Building software is a team sport.
In 2009, the first conference named DevOpsdays was held in Ghent Belgium. Belgian consultant and Patrick Debois founded the conference. In 2012, the state of DevOps report was launched and conceived by Alanna Brown at Puppet. In 2014, the annual State of DevOps report was published by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, Gene Kim, and others.
